Hello world. This site is a work in progress. Please excuse the mess.

I am a mechanical engineer working for The Aerospace Corporation since 2019 with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology and currently pursuing a PhD. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, with a (hopeful) graduation date of May 2028.

Keep an eye out. I saw some [droids](/Droids.md) wandering around.
