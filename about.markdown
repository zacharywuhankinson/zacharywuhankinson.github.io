# About Me
Hello and welcome to the personal website fo Zachary R. Wu Hankinson. 
I'm a multi-disciplinary engineer with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering 
from Rochester Institute of Technology, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD in 
Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California. This site is still 
very new, so please forgive its sparsity, but I intend to build it up to serve as a 
secondary showcase for my projects and skills.
